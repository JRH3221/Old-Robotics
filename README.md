# Robotics

All code is free for use and editing. There are multiple branches with different code programs. All code is currently from a 3 wheel omni soccer robot.

## New Developments 
A new Repo will be made for the compiled C version of the programming.
The repo can be found here: https://github.com/JRH3221/CType-Ev3
