# List of things to do

Measure the raw value of the plotting output going from middle to each side of the pitch, then divide it by the amount of mm the pitch is to each respective side, then use that calculated value for a division factor. Refer to 5.0 for more info

Figure out the output of the compass sensor

Fill in margin_y with the distance from start to end of the pitch in mm. Fill in margin_x with the distance from start to side of the pitch in mm.

# Programs to run
start with version 4.0, if it works well then the robot will be competative. Then merge it with main.

run the 5.0  demo and proof testing program and fix any bugs present. At this point 5.0 should be finished along with 5.1.

run 5.0 and if it works as intended then merge with main. 

run the 5.1 ball kicker test program, make fixes then merge with the full 5.1 program.

if 5.1 goes well then merge with main.

make 5.1E and merge with main if working

The robot at this point has nearly every feature intended for the end, the milstone will be changed as to not include robot avoidance.
but if this point is reached with time to spare, the next thing to do is to create 6.0 with robot avoidance, if this goes well merge
with main, then last is 6.0E which will use the same efficiency tactics as 5.1E but with the 6.0 code
