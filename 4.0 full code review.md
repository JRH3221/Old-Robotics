# 1 - 12
This imports all needed libraries including; PyBricks default library, PyBricks Ev3devsensor, Time, Math

# 14 - 28
this sets up all needed objects and variables this includes; main brick, sensors and motors, trigonometry values for the wheel rotation from center (0), speed values for different uses

# 30 - 59
This is the whole wheelbase class including; calculation for all wheel speeds depending on a vector, calculations to account for wanted rotation during operation, running motors with both calculation accounted for

# 62 - 151
This is the main brains functions. This function runs all the different operations and does all the decision making this includes; reading values from sensors, checking if the ball is in sight, checking if the ball is readable in different reading modes, checking rotation to the oposite goals heading, run drive base operation calculated by current ball direction and robot heading
